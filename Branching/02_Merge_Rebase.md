# Work on Git History

* git merge
* git rebase
* git tag

~~~SECTION:handouts~~~

****

`git merge` allows you to join one or more commit histories together.

`git rebase` imports the commit history from the given head, and adds your local commit
history on top.

`git tag` adds a pointer to the current commit. This is useful to tag release versions, e.g.
`v2.4.5` or any specific milestone. You can also list, delete and verify these tags. If you
want to sign the commit using your GPG key, add `-s`.

Additional exercises for merge and rebase will
be discussed in the Git Workflows chapter.
