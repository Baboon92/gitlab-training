****

`git init` initializes an empty directory as local git repository.

`git clone` clones a copy of an existing remote git repository. 

When you clone a repository, Git automatically adds a shortcut called
`origin` that points back to the "parent" repository, under the assumption
that you'll want to interact with it further on down the road.
