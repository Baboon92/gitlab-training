Patches to fix mistakes or add optional content are always appreciated. If you want to see
changes on the default content of the training we are open for suggestions but keep in mind
that the training is intended for a three day hands-on training.

The rendered content will be updated at least if we do a newer version of the material which
will also be tagged on git.
