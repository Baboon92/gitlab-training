`git fetch` downloads objects and references from another remote repository.

`git pull` invokes a fetch and updates the local history with commits from the remote repository.

`git push` updates remote references and pushes your local commit history to the remote repository.

`git remote` allows you to configure and list the remote repository. By default this is called `origin`.
