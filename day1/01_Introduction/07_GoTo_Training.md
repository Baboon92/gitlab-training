# Join a session via Instant Join

When the Instant Join app has been enabled by the organizer, GoToTraining will automatically detect the optimal join method for each attendee.

* If you join from Google Chrome or if your operating system is not compatible with the desktop app, then you will automatically join the session using the Instant Join app.
