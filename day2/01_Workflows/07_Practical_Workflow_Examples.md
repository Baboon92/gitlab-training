# Practical Examples for Git Workflows

If you are using GitHub repositories, use the forking model which integrates best.

Smart adoptions of the Gitflow workflow could include the following:

* development branch ("master")
* release branches ("support/<version>")
* Fix and feature branches are based off the master
* Bugfixes are cherry-picked into the release branches

This requires a naming schema for branches as well as deep integration
with ticket systems.
